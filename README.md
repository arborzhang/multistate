# multistate
# Multistate model describes the changes in diseaseâ€™s status over time, and more specifically, 
#it is concerned about not only the outcome states but also subsequent events after the first state. 
#The starting and final states do not have to be single and patients pass 
##through more than one intermediate state.18 Multistate model is a useful tool to describe a process of movement through a finite number of states in a continuous time. 
# this file is to show how to run multistate models using simulation dataset.
